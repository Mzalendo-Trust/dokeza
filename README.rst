Dokeza 2.0 Platform
===================

The **Dokeza platform** allows the Kenyan public to participate in the development of a legislative bill in a structured manner. The platform allows for sections of legislative bills to be annotated and commented on. 

The ability for an interested member of the public to comment on the entire bill is also possible. Go to the `Dokeza platform <https://dokeza.mzalendo.com/>`_ and have a look at how it is done.

The Dokeza Platform will enhance *Public Participation* as well as *Access to Information*. The platform will generate user informed memoranda from the annotations and this will be compared to actual Bill. The memoranda will be presented with the bill for further Parliamentary committee deliberation, assent and the gazetting.
